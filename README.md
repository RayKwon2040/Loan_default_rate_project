# Loan_default_rate_project

## Project Goal

Anonymized Loan Default data includes 37 variables such as loan amount, term, interest rate, installment, employment length, home ownership, annual income, loan status, and purpose, among others.

Loan default is a critical problem because it causes direct financial losses for lenders, as well as liquidity issues and operational disruptions. Therefore, predictive models must be developed to help prevent these issues.
